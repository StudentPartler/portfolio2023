          <p>Hello, I'm Eric NIEE, and I want to share a little about me.
            I'm someone who believes in setting big goals and working really hard to achieve them. 
            My story begins in a beautiful place called Mauritius Island, a paradise with stunning
            nature and friendly people.</p>

            <p>Around 14 years ago, I made the big move to Dublin, Ireland. That's where my career in 
              the hotel business started, mostly working in Hilton hotels. I began as a trainee, 
              learning the ropes and gaining experience. As time passed, I worked my way up the ladder 
              and became a part of the hotel's management team. My time in the hotel industry was all 
              about putting in hard work and giving my best to make guests happy.</p>

            <p>But life can bring unexpected twists and turns. I found myself in County Longford, a 
              place quite different from the bustling Dublin hotel scene. Unfortunately, there weren't 
              many job opportunities in the hotel industry there. It was a challenging situation. 
              That's when I faced a tough decision, and it led me to make a big change in my life.</p>

            <p>I decided to go back to school. Currently, I'm studying at TUS Athlone University, 
                working towards a Bachelor of Science degree in 'Software Development with Mobile Apps 
                & Connected Devices.' It's a four-year program that has opened up new horizons for me. 
                This was a significant shift in my career path, transitioning from the world of hotels 
                to the realm of technology. It's a change filled with excitement and the promise of a 
                bright future in a field that's always evolving.</p>
            
            <p>My life story is all about a few important things. Firstly, it's about working really hard. 
              It's about giving your best, whether you're serving guests in hotels or diving into the 
              world of software development. It's about putting your heart and soul into every task.</p>

            <p>Also, my story is about being willing to change and adapt. Leaving behind what you know and 
              stepping into new territory can be daunting. But it's a path I was willing to take. It's a 
              journey about staying strong, being eager to learn and grow, and approaching change with an 
              open mind and a strong will to succeed.</p>  

            <p>Lastly, my story is about always striving for something better. It's about raising the bar, 
              setting new goals, and working hard to do your best. It's the belief that no matter where you 
              come from or what you've done before, there's always room for improvement. It's about pushing 
              your limits and exploring new things, both in your job and your personal life.</p>

            <p>As I embark on this new phase of my life, where technology and innovation take center stage, 
              I carry these principles with me. They are like the foundation upon which I'm building my 
              future. I'm excited about the opportunities that lie ahead, the challenges I'm going to 
              embrace, and the growth that's awaiting me.</p>
